      content: "@benjamin-slack Hi Benjamin - thank you for your interest! Our main competitors are traditional infrastructure investment platforms and direct infrastructure providers. The main differences between those platforms and Siscom Africa are (1) our accessibility - we are the only infrastructure investment marketplace that makes opportunities accessible to retail investors with low minimums. We also require all projects to provide detailed financial projections and complete technical assessments before they can be listed. (2) Ease of use - we have the easiest to use platform experience, which gives investors control over their infrastructure investments, but also the ability to discover and invest in minutes. With other platforms, you need to be an accredited investor and go through complex processes. (3) Transparency - we are the only platform that allows investors to see detailed project information, expected returns, and risk profiles all in one place. This prevents any confusion about investment terms and helps both investors and project teams keep clear records. I hope you will check out Siscom Africa when you are ready to make your first infrastructure investment!",

This immediate cash will be used to invest in customer support and engineering ahead of those partnership announcements to ensure we can scale with demand.",

As I mentioned to Dave (above), we have a few partnerships coming live (agreements are signed) in the next two months, which will significantly increase our scale and volume. We believe this is likely to result in new opportunities for a liquidity event in the next 1-2 years. I hope that helps.",
